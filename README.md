### Conclusion
Apriori Algorithm :

It is a classic algorithm for learning association rules.
It uses a bottom up approach where frequent subsets are extended one at a time.
It uses Breadth first search and hash tree structure to count candidate item sets efficiently.
FP Growth:

It allows frequent item set discovery without candidate generation.
It builds a compact data structure called FP tree with two passes over thedatabase.
It extracts frequent item sets directly from the FP tree and traverses through the FP tree.
