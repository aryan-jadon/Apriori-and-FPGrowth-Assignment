### Conclusion
Apriori Algorithm :

1. It is a classic algorithm for learning association rules.
2. It uses a bottom up approach where frequent subsets are extended one at a time.
3. It uses Breadth first search and hash tree structure to count candidate item sets efficiently.

FP Growth:

1. It allows frequent item set discovery without candidate generation.
2. It builds a compact data structure called FP tree with two passes over thedatabase.
3. It extracts frequent item sets directly from the FP tree and traverses through the FP tree.
